An add-on can specify one or\nmore content scripts to load for a panel, and the add-on can communicate with\nthose scripts either using the `message` event or by using user-defined\nevents. See\n[Working with Content Scripts](dev-guide/addon-development/web-content.html)\nfor more information.\n\nThe panel's default style is different for each operating system.\nFor example, suppose a panel's content is specified with the following HTML:\n\n<script type=\"syntaxhighlighter\" class=\"brush: html\"><![CDATA[\n<h1>Default Style</h1>\n\nThis is what a panel with no custom styling looks like.\n]]>\n</script>\n\nOn OS X it will look like this:\n\n<img class=\"image-center\" src=\"media/screenshots/default-panel-osx.png\"\nalt=\"OS X panel default style\">\n<br>\n\nOn Windows 7 it will look like this:\n\n<img class=\"image-center\" src=\"media/screenshots/default-panel-windows.png\"\nalt=\"Windows 7 panel default style\">\n<br>\n\nOn Ubuntu it will look like this:\n\n<img class=\"image-center\" src=\"media/screenshots/default-panel-ubuntu.png\"\nalt=\"Ubuntu panel default style\">\n<br>\n\nThis helps to ensure that the panel's style is consistent with the dialogs\ndisplayed by Firefox and other applications, but means you need to take care\nwhen applying your own styles. For example, if you set the panel's\n`background-color` property to `white` and do not set the `color` property,\nthen the panel's text will be invisible on OS X although it looks fine on Ubuntu.\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nCreate and show a simple panel with content from the `data/` directory:\n\n    const data = require(\"self\").data;\n    var panel = require(\"panel\").Panel({\n      contentURL: data.url(\"foo.html\")\n    });\n\n    panel.show();\n\nThe tutorial section on\n[web content](dev-guide/addon-development/web-content.html) has\na more complex example using panels.\n\n"], ["api-json", {"line_number": 80, "name": "Panel", "constructors": [{"line_number": 95, "name": "Panel", "params": [{"line_number": 98, "name": "options", "datatype": "object", "required": true, "props": [{"datatype": "number", "line_number": 100, "required": false, "name": "width", "description": "The width of the panel in pixels.
